# BRAND STORY
**LEARN. CONNECT. GROW,**

Tuklas was born out of a simple yet powerful idea: learning
shouldn’t be limited to classrooms—it should be a shared
experience.

At City University of Seattle, our students aren’t just students—
they’re working professionals, entrepreneurs, and changemakers.
Many juggle jobs, side hustles, and studies, gaining real-world
experience along the way. But while they have expertise to share,
finding a way to connect and learn from each other isn’t always
easy.

At the same time, nonprofits, startups, and small businesses
struggle with limited funding and resources. They need to wear
many hats—from marketing and finance to project management
and design. But where can they learn these skills without
spending money they don’t have?

Enter Tuklas.

Tuklas is a student-led, community-driven learning platform that allows
people to teach, learn, and connect—for free. Whether you're a student
looking to develop new skills, a business person seeking knowledge
without expensive consultants, or a professional eager to give back,
Tuklas brings people together in an ecosystem of shared learning.
